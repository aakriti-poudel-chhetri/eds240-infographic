# Chemicals in Cosmetics

This repository contains the details of the final project for the course EDS 240 - Data Visualization & Communication for the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program.

## Background
The California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) collects information on cosmetic products sold in California that contain ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. The program makes this information publicly available to promote awareness and safety.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the CSCP data to identify which cosmetic products and brands most often contain harmful chemicals, find the most common hazardous ingredients, and explore patterns across different product types. This helps make cosmetic safety information easier to understand and use.
